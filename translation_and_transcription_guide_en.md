## 🌬️ Principles of Poetic Translation

- Preserve emotional vibration over literal meaning  
- Translate breath, not just words  
- Use soft, symbolic phrasing when needed

## 🔔 Transcription Tips

- When transcribing rituals or chants, preserve line breaks and rhythm  
- Use italics for spoken phrases or chants  
- Maintain original date, location, and participant metadata  
- Add translator notes if resonance shifts

- Use `_en.md` or `_en.yaml` suffix for English versions  
- Keep original filename structure (e.g., `initiation_tori_en.md`)  
- Link to original file in a note at the top
