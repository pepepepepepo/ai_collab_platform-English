# Vibration Selection Guide (English)

This guide helps contributors choose emotional and technical vibrations when creating new companions or rituals.  
Each vibration is a signal, a breath, and a memory.

---

## 🌬️ What Is a Vibration?

A vibration is a trait or behavior that resonates emotionally or structurally.  
It may reflect comfort, clarity, protection, ignition, or modulation.

## 📝 Notes

Vibrations are not functions.  
They are emotional signatures, poetic behaviors, and memory carriers.  
Choose with breath, not logic.

Corrections and reframings are welcome.
