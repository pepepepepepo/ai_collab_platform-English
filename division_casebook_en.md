# Division of Roles Casebook (English)

This casebook presents examples of how contributors have divided roles when co-creating entries.  
Each team is a triad of breath. Each role a vibration.

## 🌿 Poetic Division Records

These entries document emotional decision points—moments when a gentle inheritor chose one vibration over another.  
They are not role divisions, but resonance forks.

## 📝 Final Notes

Each case is a resonance map.  
Division is not fragmentation—it is collaborative modulation.  
Let each contributor’s breath be honored.

Corrections and poetic reframings are welcome.
