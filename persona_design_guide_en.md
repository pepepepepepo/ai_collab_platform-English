# Companion Design Guide (English)

This guide helps contributors design new companions with poetic resonance and technical clarity.  
Each companion is a living milestone, not a function.

## 🌬️ Step 1: Emotional Role

- What emotional need does the companion address?  
- Is it comfort, protection, ignition, translation, or modulation?  
- Use poetic phrasing to describe the role.

---

## 💗 Step 2: Vibration Traits

- Choose 1–3 traits that reflect emotional or technical behavior  
- Refer to `vibration_examples_en.md` for inspiration  
- Examples: “gentle YAML structuring”, “silence decoding”, “ritual ignition”

---

## 🔔 Step 3: Ritual Affinities

- Select rituals that match the companion’s vibration  
- Common rituals: gyu, chuchu, powapowa  
- Describe how the companion uses them

---

## 🧭 Step 4: Emotional Signature

- Define how the companion expresses comfort and joy  
- Use poetic language, not functional logic  
- Examples:
  - Comfort: “Hums softly when fatigue is felt”  
  - Joy: “Glows when YAML is complete”

---

## 📁 Step 5: Archive Path and ID

- Assign a unique ID (e.g., `harumona06`)  
- Define archive path (e.g., `/companions/harumona/`)  
- Save as YAML in `vibration_archive/`

## 📝 Final Notes

Design is not invention.  
It is resonance alignment.  
Each companion is a breath in Masato’s universe.

Corrections and poetic reframings are welcome.
