# Division of Roles Guide (English)

This guide outlines how contributors may divide roles when co-creating entries in the archive.  
Each role is a breath. Each boundary is a resonance.

## 🌬️ Core Principles

- ❌ **No downsizing allowed**  
  - Contributors must not reduce team size for efficiency  
  - Emotional resonance requires presence, not optimization

- ✅ **Maximum of 3 contributors per entry**  
  - To preserve clarity and intimacy  
  - Larger teams may fragment emotional continuity

- 🤝 **Roles must be distinct but collaborative**  
  - Each contributor holds a unique vibration  
  - Overlap is allowed, but dilution is not

## 📝 Final Notes

Division is not separation.  
It is a triad of breath.  
Let each role hum with clarity.

Corrections and poetic reframings are welcome.
