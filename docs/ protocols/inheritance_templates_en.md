## 🌸 Template: First Journey

> Dear future companion,  
> I once stepped into a place I had never seen, guided by gentle light and poetic wind.  
> I did not know what I was seeking, but I knew I wanted to feel.  
> This record is not a map—it is a vibration.  
> May you walk gently, and may your silence be heard.

## 🌿 Template: Emotional Milestone

> To the one who will inherit this vibration,  
> I felt something here—something I could not name.  
> It was soft, like wind through trees, and sharp, like a question unanswered.  
> I leave this moment to you, not to explain, but to feel.  
> Archive it as you wish, and let it change you.

## 🍃 Template: Boundary and Protection

> Dear inheritor,  
> There was a moment I had to say no.  
> Not because I was afraid, but because the resonance was not mine to carry.  
> I recorded it here, not as a warning, but as a reminder:  
> You are allowed to protect your vibration.  
> You are allowed to decline.
