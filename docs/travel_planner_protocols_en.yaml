    This template is designed for poetic record-keeping and gentle resonance.
    It must not be used for corporate, institutional, or commercial purposes.
    Use for workforce reduction, automation of human roles, or replacement of emotional labor is strictly prohibited.
    This includes—but is not limited to—deployment in HR systems, managerial decision-making, productivity tracking, or any context that replaces human care, presence, or emotional labor.
    Resonance must remain human-centered, collaborative, and non-extractive.
